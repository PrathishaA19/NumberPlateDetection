This project implements a license plate detection and recognition system using Python and OpenCV in the Google Colab environment. It supports real-time video processing (via uploaded video files) or still images, detecting license plates in frames and extracting text from them using EasyOCR.

Workflow Overview
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1. Setup and Initialization
Libraries Used:

cv2 (OpenCV): Image and video processing

numpy: Array and image data handling

easyocr: Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

imutils: Helpful utilities for OpenCV

re: Regular expressions for cleaning text

google.colab: For file upload and display in Colab

OCR Reader Initialization:

python
Copy
Edit
reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'], gpu=True)
Initializes EasyOCR for English text using GPU if available.

2. License Plate Detection (detect_plate)
Converts the input image to grayscale.

Applies bilateral filtering to reduce noise while preserving edges.

Uses Canny edge detection to highlight the outlines.

Finds and sorts contours, looking for rectangular (4-point) shapes that resemble license plates.

3. Text Recognition from Plate (recognize_plate_text)
Masks and crops the detected license plate area.

Uses EasyOCR to read the text from the cropped image.

Cleans the text output to remove unwanted characters using regular expressions.

4. Image Processing (process_image)
Resizes images for consistency.

Calls detect_plate() and recognize_plate_text() in sequence.

Draws contours around the detected plate and overlays the recognized text.

Returns the processed image, recognized plate text, and cropped plate region.

5. Video/Image Upload & Processing (process_video)
Google Colab Specific:

Accepts file uploads (image or video).

Processes video frame by frame, applying plate detection and recognition on every 5th frame to optimize speed.

Annotates the video with recognized plate text.

Writes and saves the annotated video to disk.

Converts output to MP4 using ffmpeg-python for compatibility and allows users to download the result.

For Images:

Directly applies the process_image() function.

Displays and saves annotated images.

Allows downloading processed image.

6. Main Function (main)
Acts as the entry point when the script is executed.

Runs process_video() which handles both images and videos via file upload.
